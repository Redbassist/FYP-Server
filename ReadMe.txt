FINAL YEAR PROJECT 
2DZ

Overview

The Elevator Pitch / High Concept
2DZ is a top down, two dimensional exploration game where players fight against the elements, foreign invaders and even other humans to collect, defend and survive.

Theme, Setting and Genre
The game will be set in the present day in a post invasion setting, the hollow remains of human society. The game is a 2d survival / exploration shooter.


Core aesthetics
Fear / Intensity. The game will keep players on their toes, with sound and visuals that play to their primal instincts to protect themselves.
Post-Apocalypse. It is the thought that has passed through most minds, what if everything fell apart, how will you survive?
Human - Human interaction. (i.e. network chat) Will you work with your fellow man to build supplies and defences or will you aggressively take what you think is yours, what you need. 
Looting. Making sure you as a player has the best gear in the game, to fight back against the invaders and even other players.
Crafting. Creating something from practically nothing.
Base Building. Creating your own defenses that are personal to you and those you allow to enter.

Look and feel
The game is set in a post apocalyptic world, where buildings are falling in on themselves and nature is beginning to take over once again from what is left. 

View
The game has a top down view with the camera set squarely above the player's head with a large view of the surrounding area. The zoom will increase when the players enters a building.

Game flow summary
2DZ is a game where the player is focused on exploring the leftovers of the world to find food, water and supplies to keep him alive. The player can loot many different items in buildings and out that will contain random assets. 
The strength and armor of the player is dictated by the clothing that he/she is wearing. These clothing items are again, collected from the containers strewn throughout the world.
The player can also build a base to defend against the invaders and store the key items that they need to keep themselves alive. 
The player must manage these supplies correctly as not to put themselves in an unwinnable situation.
The only goal is to live for as long as possible, you lose everything once you die and there is only so much you can recover when that happens.
The game demands some skill but is an easy game to pick up and play, but once that demands time to get oneself setup in the world they have chosen.
